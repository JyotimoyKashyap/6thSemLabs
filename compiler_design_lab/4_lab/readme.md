# States in Lex Programming 

Matching C styled comments in lex is documented already. Here, normal ways to match any comment might not work. If it works even but it might be too long or overwhelming. To simply the process, we use states in lex programming to handle this type of cases. 

This state is required because of multiline comments

Please refer the guide to states in lex programming from [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=information-lex-program-start-conditions)
